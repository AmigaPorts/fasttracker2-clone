This repo is a fork of Olaf Sørensen's ft2-clone that you can find here: https://16-bits.org/ft2.php
The main purpose of this fork is to support older systems and big endian systems.

Master branch is purely the work of Olaf Sørensen, sdl12-bigendian branch (main branch of this repo) is done by Marlon Beijer (me)
